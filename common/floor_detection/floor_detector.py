class FloorDetector(object):
    '''Uses smart wheel pressure sensor measurements for determining the current floor
    of a robot. The floor is determined by checking whether the measurements are within given
    measurement limits; proper calibration of the pressure sensors is expected. The detector
    uses a median filter on a set of measurements and, if there are redundant
    pressure measurements, calculates an average of the measurements before
    determining the floor.

    Constructor keyword arguments:

    reference_floor: int -- floor with respect to which measurements pressure
                            measurements are expressed
    floor_measurement_map: Dict[int, float] -- a dictionary in which the keys
                           are floor numbers and the values are average
                           differences in pressure measurements with respect
                           to the reference floor
    pressure_diff_tolerance: float -- allowed deviation from the values in
                                      floor_measurement_map
    redundant_measurement_count: int -- number of pressure measurements per time unit
    filter_window_size: int -- window size used for median filtering (default 5)
